Object of the Game
-----------------------
Be the first player to sink all of the opposing player's ships.

Basic Rules of the Game
----------------------------
Fleet Commander is an advanced variation of Classic Battleship.
Ships can only be placed horizontally or vertically on the gameboard grid, not diagonally.
Player 1 always moves first.
Players alternate turns, moving each of their own ships on the grid and firing at their opponent's fleet.

Choose a Grid
-----------------
Fleet Commander features two different gameboard grid sizes:

20 x 20
30 x 30

Select the grid size on which you want to play.

Create Your Own Fleet?
---------------------------
At the start of a Fleet Commander game, Player 1 must choose whether or not to allow each player to create their own fleet.

Yes - If "Yes" is selected, both players must create their own fleet. See How to Create Your Own Fleet below.

No - If "No" is selected, both players begin the game with the same number and type of ships as defined by the game's default.


How to Create Your Own Fleet
-------------------------------
To create your own fleet, you must select ships from the Ship Window (the far left column) and place them in your Fleet Window (the far right column). Each ship has a point value that is deducted from the total points 
(130) allowed for a fleet. Note: If you prefer, you can click on the "Default" button to use the game's default fleet of ships, which consists of one of each of the following ships:

Ship^T0075Point Cost
-----------------------------
Carrier^T007535
Battleship^T007530
Cruiser^T007530
Submarine^T007515
Destroyer^T007515

To select a ship, click on it. Drag the selected ship to your Fleet Window. Click again to place the ship in your Fleet Window. If you change your mind and would like to remove a ship already placed in your Fleet Window, click on the desired ship to select it, and then drag it back to its place in the Ship Window. Click again to release the ship.

***                The Special Actions               ***
*********************************************
CARRIER
---------
The carrier comes with two types of special air units: the AWAC reconnaissance plane, and the jet fighter.

AWAC Reconnaissance Plane - This plane autonomously flies to a point that you have selected and then flies straight back to the carrier. The AWAC has a large viewing radius, enabling you to see your opponent's ships as you fly pass them. Be careful. This plane can be shot down by any ship or plane that sees it. 

Jet Fighter - You control your Jet Fighters after you launch them. These fighters carry three shots, can move up to four grid spaces, and can move diagonally. Once a plane's three shots have been used, the plane must fly back 
to the carrier to reload. Warning! These Jet Fighters can be shot down by enemy fighters and ships. Important! You can only launch one plane per turn. 

BATTLESHIP
-------------
The battleship carries five cruise missiles for extra firepower.

Cruise Missiles - These missiles act like normal shots, but are limited in number. Once you use them, you cannot get them back. Important! You can only fire one cruise missile per turn. 

CRUISER
---------
The cruiser has a special satellite system to help you detect the enemy.

Satellite System - Launching this system allows you to see specific areas of the grid. Exception: The satellite system cannot detect submarines. Important! You can only use this ability every other turn. 

SUBMARINE
------------
The stealthy submarine can normally only be seen by destroyers, other submarines, and planes. Other types of ships can only see the submarine if they are in a grid space adjacent to the submarine.

DESTROYER
------------
Destroyers have the ability to see submarines from up to 3 spaces away.


Position Your Ships
----------------------
Position your ships by left-clicking your mouse to pick to them up, and then left-clicking your mouse again to place them back on the grid. Right-clicking your mouse while you have a ship selected rotates that ship. Important! In Fleet Commander, you may only initially place your ships in your half of the grid. Once you have positioned your ships, click on the "Play Turn" button. Follow the on-screen instructions to contact your opponent and initiate the start of the game.
