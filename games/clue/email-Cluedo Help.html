Click this button to make an accusation, whereby you'll choose a room, suspect, and weapon. Players can only make one accusation per game.</p>

<p><b>Done</b><br>

<LI>The rooms in opposite corners of the mansion (the Study, Lounge, Kitchen, and Conservatory) are connected by secret passages.

<li><b>Netscape Users</b> If you are using Netscape to read your email, the first time you click on the attachment it will ask you if you want to <b>Open</b> or <b>Save</b> the attachment. We recommend that you open it.</P>

<p>
<li><b>AOL Users</b> Some older versions of AOL do not allow for a true TCP\IP connection to the Internet. If you experience any problems sending turns with AOL try upgrading to AOL 4.0.</li></ul></p>

<p>To open a turn file using AOL, you will first need to download it to your hard drive. The default directory for AOL downloads is:  C:\America Online 4.0\download (for AOL 4.0), and C:\AOL3.0\download (for AOL 3.0). Then you will need to go to the appropriate folder and double-click on the downloaded file to open and play the turn.</p>
