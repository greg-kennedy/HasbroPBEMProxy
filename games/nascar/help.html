<FONT SIZE=2><P>The smell of burning rubber, the roar of the crowd. . . adrenaline courses through your veins as you bank hard into turn number four. You've been chasing the leader for what seems like an eternity, but you're close, real close. You slide into position and draft him, perspiration gluing your hands to your gloves; tension, your gloves to the wheel. One more lap to go. The checkered flag is unfurling. Victory lane awaits the winner. You take it high into turn number three, put the pedal down, and make your move. </P>
<P>Welcome to Hasbro's <I>Em@il NASCAR,</I> the game that puts you behind the wheel of your own racecar. Choose from a list of real NASCAR drivers like Jeff Gordon, Mark Martin, or seven-time Winston Cup Champion Dale Earnhardt as you try to maneuver your way to victory. Challenge friends and foes alike to some turn-based head-to-head competition. </P>
<P>But watch out! The track is littered with obstacles, and your buddies are closing in fast. Only your patience, poise, and ingenuity will earn you that coveted checkered flag and the sweet taste of victory in the Winner's Circle. </P></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>It's finally time to strap on your lucky helmet and get to the action. The Track Screen is where all of the fun and excitement of <I>Em@il NASCAR</I> actually takes place. Players must first determine their speed and control ratings by either skill shot or die roll mode (as determined by the Game Option Settings). Once a player's speed and control rating have been determined, he then has the option of using event cards and/or plotting his movement around the track.</FONT> </P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Speed and Control Ratings</B></FONT> </P><DIR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2><P>Speed Rating</B>: The player's speed rating determines the amount of spaces a player's vehicle can move per turn. Speed ratings range from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 10. </P>
<B><P>Control Rating</B>: The player's control rating determines which hazards can be ignored and which will inflict damage to the player's vehicle if encountered that turn. Hazards will assume a gray appearance when rendered ineffective by a higher control rating. Control ratings range from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 10.</FONT> </P></DIR>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Rate Determination Modes</B></FONT> </P><DIR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2><P>Skill Shot Mode</B>: The skill shot is a test of the player's coordination by means of advancing power meter bars, which determine speed and control ratings for the turn. </P>
<P>When the player is ready, he will left-click on the blinking red button to start the movement of the bar. The player then clicks a second time to stop the bar. The player's first attempt will determine the speed rating for the upcoming turn while the second attempt will determine the control rating. </P>
<P>When performing the speed skill shot, you are attempting to hold down the button until the advancing bar is as close to the end of the box as possible. The closer the red bar to the end of the box, the higher your speed rating. However, if you hold down too long and let the bar strike the end of the box, your scores will result in 4 Speed and 2 Control. If you do not overshoot on your speed skill shot, you will then perform the control skill shot. Here you are attempting to halt the blue control bar as close to the end of the red speed bar as possible. If you overshoot on this attempt, you will end up with a 2 Control rating, though this does not affect your Speed score.</P>
<B><P>Die Roll Mode</B>: Speed and control ratings are randomly generated for the turn by left clicking on the blinking red button.</P></DIR>

<FONT SIZE=2>A player's vehicle can take damage in one of two ways: </P>
<OL>

<LI>By running into a hazard that has not been overcome by a sufficient control rating. </LI>
<LI>By having a Hazard Card played on his vehicle by an opponent. </LI></OL>

<P>Accumulated damage is recorded by the Damage Meter, located to the left of the space allotted for the player's event cards. </P><DIR>

<FONT SIZE=2>Hazards occupy a space on the racing track and can inflict damage to any car that enters that space. </P><DIR>

<B><P>Rendering Hazards Ineffective</B>: Only a high control rating will allow a vehicle to move into a space occupied by a hazard without sustaining damage. Hazards that have been rendered ineffective for the turn by a high control rating become grayed out. </P>
<B><P>Oil</B>: Oil on the track is a fairly common occurrence, requiring only a moderate control score of five or better to overcome. Oil inflicts 10% damage to a vehicle that does not have an adequate control score. </P>
<B><P>Debris</B>: Debris is a moderate hazard that includes random pieces of flotsam and jetsam that accumulate on the track. Debris inflicts 20% damage to a vehicle that does not have a control score of eight or better. </P>
<B><P>Wreckage</B>: Wreckage is a major hazard that has the ability to inflict extensive damage to a vehicle that enters the space it occupies. Only with a control score of a perfect ten can a player drive through wreckage without mishap. Wreckage inflicts 30% damage to a vehicle that fails to avoid it. </P></DIR>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Event Cards</B></FONT> <BR>
