***     E-Mail Games - A Brief Overview         ***
*******************************************************
Hasbro Interactive Email Games are played by sending turns back and forth via email to your opponent. To view your opponent's last move, simply open the attached "TURN" file emailed to you by your opponent. This will
automatically open up the proper Email Game and allow you to play the next move.

It's that easy!

***         How to Start a New Game               ***
*******************************************************
You must have the Email - Grand Master Chess, Draughts & Backgammon CD-ROM game disc in your CD-ROM drive to begin a new game. Great News! Your opponent does not have to have the CD-ROM game disc to be able to play . The player who starts a new game automatically becomes Player 1.

***   The Rules of Draughts - A Summary      ***
*******************************************************
Object
------
Be the first player to capture all of your opponent's counters.

Basic Rules of the Game
--------------------
Player 1 always moves first.
Players alternate turns, moving one piece per turn.
Counters can move diagonally forward only, from one black square to an adjoining black square.

Force Jumps
-----------
At the start of a Draughts game, Player 1 must choose whether or not to force jumps throughout the game.

Yes - If "Yes" is selected, a player must jump an opponent's piece if in a position to do so on his/her turn.

No - If "No" is selected, a player does not have to jump an opponent's piece, even if in a position to do so.

Jumping
-------
A player captures an opposing counter by diagonally jumping over it when the square behind the opposing counter is empty. A counter can make multiple jumps as long as it continues to move forward. Captured pieces are
automatically removed from the board and placed in the player's Captured Pieces window.

Crowning
--------
When a counter reaches the first row of the opponent's side of the board, it is "crowned" with one of the player's captured pieces and becomes a "King."
This ends your turn.

Note: The King can diagonally move or jump either forward or backwards.

How to Win
----------
If you block your opponent's forces so that they cannot move, or you capture all of them, you win!
